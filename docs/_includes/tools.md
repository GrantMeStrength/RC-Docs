### Before you begin..

Tool list and other requiremets

* Good soldering iron
* Good quality solder
* Wire cutters
* Tape (to hold components in place as you solder - blue painter's tape is ideal)
* A frame or other device to hold the circuit board as you solder

### Cautions

* Please take care with working with a soldering iron, especicallty when children or pets are around. Always remember to turn it off when you are done.
* Wear eye protection when soldering.
* Solder can contain lead, so avoid breathing in fumes, or eating or drinking while you work.
* Handling components. Some components can be damanged by static electricity, so find a metal surface to discharge yourself before handling ICs.
* Some components must be installed in a specific orientation: ICs, diodes, crystals, LEDs and some capacitors must be connected the right way around. Please double-check before soldering.

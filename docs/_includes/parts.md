The kit ships with the following parts. Please take care to identify each correctly - some look very similar. Resistors are identified with the [Resistor Color Codes](appendices/resistor_color_codes.htm). IC's are numbered from the notch. [appendices/ic_numbers.html]. Diodes and LEDs must be connected the right way around.

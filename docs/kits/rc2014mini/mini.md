# RC2014 Mini

## Description

The RC2014 Mini is a single board computer which combines the CPU, ROM, RAM, Clock, Serial I/O and Pi Terminal of the classic modular RC2014 on to a single PCB.

Having all the functions on a single board reduces the component count and therefore the amount of soldering compared to the modular equivalent.  It also allows more efficient use of the logic chips.  This efficiency comes at the expense of upgradability, where the modular option allows for any of the functions to be replaced if required.  The likelihood of wanting to swap major components should be weighed up to determine if the modular or the Mini approach is right for you.
